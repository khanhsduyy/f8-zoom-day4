                        Include a skills section - it's incredibly important.
                        This step will prove highly valuable if the company uses
                        ATS (applicant tracking system).

                        areas of responsibility, you need to quantify the impact
                        of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for numbers, so
                        quantify as much as you can.

                        Carefully review your resume several times to eliminate
                        any typos. Additionally, consider having someone else
                        proofread it to prevent sending an imperfect resume.
